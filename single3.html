							<h5><a href="#">SPINESOOTHE: DEMONSTRATING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF RULE-BASED EXPERT SYSTEMS</a></h5>
							<p>SpineSoothePro is a demo project aimed at showcasing the functionality of rule-based expert systems in addressing back pain relief. Designed with a user-friendly interface, this system allows users to input the location of their back pain – upper, middle, lower, or full – and generates personalized exercise recommendations accordingly. Leveraging a rule and knowledge base, SpineSoothePro analyzes user input to provide tailored suggestions aimed at alleviating stress and promoting relaxation. Each exercise recommendation is accompanied by detailed descriptions and instructional resources, enhancing user understanding and engagement. Furthermore, SpineSoothePro offers expert guidance on stress-related back pain relief techniques, enriching the user experience with valuable insights. As a demonstration project, SpineSoothePro serves as a valuable educational tool, illustrating the principles and capabilities of rule-based expert systems in a practical context. Please note that while SpineSoothePro provides helpful recommendations, it is intended for demonstration purposes only and should not replace medical advice from healthcare professionals.</p>
