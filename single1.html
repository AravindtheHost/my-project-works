							<h5><a href="#">BOT DEVELOPMENT using Google Dialogflow</a></h5>
							<p>I succeded in developing Ai chatbots using Google Dialogflow, enabling businesses to create powerful chatbots and virtual assistants that streamline customer interactions and improve user engagement.

With my expertise, I've successfully created and integrated chatbots into websites and messaging platforms like Telegram, leveraging the advanced capabilities of Google Dialogflow. These chatbots are intelligently designed to understand natural language queries, provide instant responses, and perform tasks ranging from answering frequently asked questions to executing complex commands.

My portfolio includes projects where I've seamlessly integrated Dialogflow-powered chatbots into websites, enhancing user experiences by providing quick and accurate assistance round the clock. Additionally, I've extended these chatbots to platforms like Telegram, enabling users to interact with businesses and access services directly from their preferred messaging app.

By harnessing the capabilities of Google Dialogflow, I've empowered businesses to automate customer support, increase efficiency, and drive user engagement, ultimately contributing to their success in today's digital landscape But,Please understand that its not a completed fully functional product but a demo.well it actually do all the work done by a stand alone bot and can understand speech to text.
This project is done  to showcase the working of a basic chatbot developed through google dialogue flow ,i can guarantee that i can complete the complete product but now im going for this demo.well what i actually meant by the product is not fully fledged because i haven't trained the chatbot to advance more conversation.So what i have done is developed this bot for an imaginary mocktail shop named shakehub.The bot can understand the message spoken by the user and reply with the correct intent,but because of less training in the intents ,it is able to perform only like 4 conversations.but with this model we can make a stand alone bot for a specific organsation to solve common Q/A problems automatically.This is just a Demo product .By the way Thankyou for your valuable time.
