							<h5><a href="#">CONTACT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING SQLITE AND PYTHON </a></h5>
							<p>The Contact Management System is your go-to solution for organizing and managing your contacts
							effortlessly. Built using Python and powered by the lightweight SQLite database, this
							system offers a seamless experience for handling all your contact information. It provides
							a user-friendly command-line interface, making it accessible to users of all levels.

Upon launching the system, users are greeted with a clear menu presenting various options, including adding new 
contacts, updating existing ones, or removing outdated entries. Each contact is stored with essential details
 such as name and phone number, ensuring comprehensive organization. This simplicity ensures that users can
 quickly navigate through the system and perform their desired actions without any complications.

Behind the scenes, the system efficiently manages contact data within the SQLite database, leveraging its
 robust capabilities for data storage and retrieval. This ensures that your contact information remains secure 
 and easily accessible whenever needed. Whether you're a busy professional managing client details or an individual
 keeping track of personal contacts, this system provides the functionality you need in a straightforward manner.

While the Contact Management System currently operates through a command-line interface, its versatility makes 
it suitable for various scenarios. Whether you're managing a small team or simply organizing your personal contacts,
 this system adapts to your needs with ease. Its intuitive design and efficient performance make it an indispensable
 tool for anyone looking to streamline their contact management process.</p>
